# ADR-002: Provider System Standardization

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The current provider system has inconsistencies in:
- Error handling patterns across different providers
- Authentication mechanisms and flows
- Response formatting and processing
- Rate limiting implementation
- Configuration validation

These inconsistencies lead to:
- Unpredictable user experience across providers
- Difficulty in debugging provider-specific issues
- Increased complexity when adding new providers
- Inconsistent error messages and handling

## Decision
We will standardize the provider system architecture:

1. **Implement consistent error handling** across all providers
2. **Standardize authentication patterns** with proper OAuth support
3. **Create unified response processing** pipeline
4. **Implement consistent rate limiting** mechanisms
5. **Enhance provider configuration validation**

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent user experience across all providers
- Easier to add new providers following established patterns
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Improved debugging and monitoring capabilities
- Enhanced security through standardized authentication

### Negative
- Requires refactoring existing provider implementations
- May need to update provider-specific configurations
- Temporary disruption during migration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhance Base Provider Classes
1. Update `Provider.js` with standardized error handling
2. Implement consistent authentication interface
3. Add unified response processing methods
4. Enhance rate limiting mechanisms

### Phase 2: Migrate Existing Providers
1. Update OpenAI provider to use standardized patterns
2. Update Anthropic provider implementation
3. Update Google Gemini provider
4. Update remaining providers (Cohere, HuggingFace, Local, OpenRouter)

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
1. Implement OAuth PKCE flow for supported providers
2. Add automatic model discovery capabilities
3. Enhance error categorization and user feedback
4. Add provider health monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All providers use consistent error handling patterns
- [ ] Standardized authentication interface implemented
- [ ] OAuth PKCE flow available for supported providers
- [ ] Consistent rate limiting across all providers
- [ ] Unified response processing pipeline
- [ ] Enhanced error categorization and user feedback
- [ ] All existing functionality maintained
