2. **Increase max tokens**: Allow longer, more detailed responses
3. **Lower temperature**: More consistent, focused results
4. **Use specific templates**: Tailored templates for specific use cases

### Optimizing for Cost

1. **Use cheaper models**: GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude 3 Haiku

3. **Optimize templates**: More efficient prompts
4. **Monitor usage**: Track API costs in provider dashboard

## Best Practices

- **Test templates**: Verify templates work as expected

### Review and Editing
